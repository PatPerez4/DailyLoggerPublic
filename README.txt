This is a public build of my internal web application Daily Logger.

The focus of Daily Logger was to utilize the django web framework to catalogue and track Tier 2 Users and their workload/proficiency on a day to day basis. This was achieved through a combination of manually entered data, bulk uploaded tickets that Tier 2 engineers could take on in the app,and integrations from cognito webhook.
